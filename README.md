# Cat Sound Classification Using Tensorflow

# Waveform
The generic term waveform means a graphical representation of the shape and form of a signal moving in a gaseous, liquid, or solid medium. For sound, the term describes a depiction of the pattern of sound pressure variation (or amplitude) in the time domain.

# Spectrogram
A spectrogram is a figure which represents the spectrum of frequencies of a recorded audio over time. This means that as we get brighter in color in the figure, the sound is heavily concentrated around those specific frequencies, and as we get darker in color, the sound is close to empty/dead sound.

# Tensorflow
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.
